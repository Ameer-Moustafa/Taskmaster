## About:

Taskmaster is a simple to-do list application written in vanilla JS. It was a wonderful excercise for solidifying the fundementals of DOM manipulation and handling state changes for me.

## Features:

- A fully functioning form that will take a task's name and priority then add it to the list.
- A dynamic task list that allows you to update a task's completed status as well as edit and delete it.
- The ability filter tasks by active or completed.
- The ability to sort tasks by priority.

## What I learned:
- The methodology of working with vanilla JS is wildly different than how it is done in something like React. I learned this the hard way.
- Learned about the mutation observer and using it to handle changes in the DOM.
- Solidified the fundamentals of DOM manipulation.
- Taking the time to design your UI BEFORE writing any code.
- Take the time to think about the structure of your program or time will be wasted refactoring.
